# Jar Of Kinks

**Note: kink is not always sexual, but it is still 18+ stuff. So, you know, keep that in mind.**

Why spend 5 minutes filling it in using Paint if you can spend a few hours coding it into a site?

If you just wanna use it, you can simply go to [isitdeba.github.io/jar-of-kinks](https://isitdeba.github.io/jar-of-kinks/)! 

## Running locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsItDeba/jar-of-kinks.git
cd jar-of-kinks
yarn install
yarn run build  # Build static files into dist/
yarn start  # Start local development server on localhost:1234/
```
